            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Our mission is to transform how people interact with the web by creating a browser that understands your needs, remembers what you've seen, and can take action on your behalf across any website.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
              We envision a future where navigating the web is intuitive, contextual, and powered by AI â€” eliminating information overload and making the entire internet accessible to automation.

            <h3>When will Graphene be available?</h3>
            <p>
              We're currently in private alpha. Join our waitlist to be notified when we open access.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What platforms will Graphene support?</h3>
            <p>
              Initially, we're launching on macOS, with Windows and Linux support coming soon after.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Is my browsing data private?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Your browsing data stays local to your device. The AI features work on your machine, so your sensitive information never leaves your control.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How is Graphene different from other browsers?</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional browsers that organize information in tabs, Graphene uses a node-based graph visualization. We also have built-in AI capabilities that make all websites automatable without requiring special integrations.
